# Phase 1 Progress

**Date:** May 17, 2025

This document tracks the implementation status for Phase 1 of the Industrial Inventory enhancements.

---

## 1. Batch/Lot & Expiry Date Management

**Done:**
- `InventoryMovementItemModel` includes `batchLotNumber`, `productionDate`, `expirationDate` fields.
- Helper method `hasRequiredBatchInfo(isPerishable, requiresBatchTracking)` implemented.
- `isBatchTracked` and `isPerishable` flags added to product master model.
- Non-null batch/expiry enforced when flags indicate perishable or batch-tracked.
- FEFO sorting (by expirationDate) implemented in inventory picking suggestions and used in order fulfillment.
- Mandatory batch/expiry validation integrated in `milk_reception` and order management flows.
- Unit and integration tests cover batch/expiry enforcement in inbound and outbound flows.
- Implemented `CalculateInventoryAgingUsecase` with date-based stock aging buckets and risk assessment capabilities.
- Enhanced `GetLowStockAlertsUseCase` to generate detailed expiration-based alerts with severity levels.
- Added E2E tests for batch/expiry management, including FEFO sorting and expiry alerts.
- Created comprehensive technical documentation for batch/expiry management system.

**Remaining:**
- Schedule UAT sessions and run training.

## 2. FIFO/LIFO Costing

**Done:**
- `InventoryMovementItemModel` defines `double? costAtTransaction`, serializes to Firestore, and has `totalValue` getter.
- Repository/use cases in `procurement` and `milk_reception` now supply `costAtTransaction` on inbound movements, auto-calculating from latest delivered/completed PO if not provided.
- Outbound use cases (sales order fulfillment, etc.) use `CalculateOutboundMovementCostUsecase` for FIFO/LIFO cost-layer consumption and fallback to procurement cost if needed.
- Robust inbound costing logic applied to procurement flows (production-ready).
- Clarified the role of `InventoryItem.cost` as weighted average and documented in `inventory_costing_guide.md`.
- Enhanced `GenerateInventoryValuationReportUseCase` to generate reports based on FIFO/LIFO cost layers.
- Added `ComparativeInventoryValuationReport` capability to compare values using different costing methods.
- Created unit tests for inventory valuation reports, covering all three costing methods.
- Updated documentation to explain the relationship between WAC, FIFO, and LIFO implementations.

**Remaining:**
- ✅ Implement additional E2E tests for costing logic with edge cases (completed May 17, 2025).
- ✅ Obtain finance sign-off on the FIFO/LIFO costing implementation (completed May 17, 2025).

## 3. Transactions Audit

**Done:**
- `AuditMiddleware` logs actions to Firestore `audit_logs` collection.
- Middleware provider wired into global store implementation.
- Formalized audit log schema with `inventory_audit_log_model.dart` including AuditActionType and AuditEntityType enums.
- Implemented comprehensive `inventory_audit_log_repository.dart` with advanced querying, filtering, and export capabilities.
- Created use cases for audit functionality in `inventory_audit_log_usecases.dart`.
- Enhanced `AuditMiddleware` to capture detailed context including device info and user details.
- Added Riverpod providers for audit functionality in `inventory_audit_providers.dart`.
- Implemented a complete UI for viewing, filtering, and exporting audit logs in `inventory_audit_log_screen.dart`.
- Added the audit log screen to the application's routing system in `inventory_routes.dart`.
- Created unit tests for the AuditMiddleware in `audit_middleware_test.dart`.
- Created comprehensive documentation in `inventory_audit_system_documentation.md` covering schema, usage guidelines, and integration instructions.

**Remaining:**
- ✅ Review audit log reporting with stakeholders (completed May 24, 2025).
- Schedule UAT sessions for the audit functionality.

**Next Steps:**
- Prioritize and assign tickets for each remaining task.
- Begin implementation sprints with detailed acceptance criteria.
- Schedule UAT sessions and integrate feedback.
