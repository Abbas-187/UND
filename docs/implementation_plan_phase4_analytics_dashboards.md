# Implementation Plan: Industrial Inventory - Phase 4: Advanced Inventory Analytics & Dashboards\r\n\r\n**Document Version:** 1.0\r\n**Date:** May 9, 2025\r\n**Focus:** Providing deep insights for strategic decision-making and ongoing optimization through comprehensive analytics and dashboards.\r\n\r\n## 1. Introduction\r\n\r\nThis document outlines the detailed implementation steps for developing advanced inventory analytics and dashboards. The primary goal is to transform raw inventory data (and related data from integrated modules like `forecasting`, `procurement`, `supplier`, `order_management`) into actionable insights. These insights will help in strategic decision-making, identifying areas for improvement, and monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs).\r\n\r\n## 2. Prerequisites\r\n\r\n*   **Data Availability:** All core inventory data (movements, batches, costs, locations, quality status) and relevant data from integrated modules must be accurate and accessible.\r\n*   **Reporting Infrastructure:** A basic framework or chosen technology for creating and displaying dashboards (e.g., Flutter widgets, a BI tool integration if applicable, or custom reporting views).\r\n*   **Understanding of KPIs:** Clear definition of the key performance indicators that need to be tracked.\r\n*   **Development Environment:** Standard Flutter development environment and access to the codebase.\r\n*   **Version Control:** All changes managed via Git.\r\n\r\n## 3. Detailed Implementation Steps\r\n\r\n---
\n\r\n### Step 3.1: Define Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Dashboard Requirements\r\n\r\n*   **Task:** Collaboratively define the specific KPIs and the desired layout/functionality of each dashboard with stakeholders (management, finance, operations).\r\n*   **Implementation Details:**\r\n    1.  **KPI Identification (based on Master Plan):**\r\n        *   Inventory Turnover Rates (by item, category, overall).\r\n        *   Stockout Rates (number of occurrences, duration, value of lost sales if estimable).\r\n        *   Reasons for Stockouts (e.g., forecast inaccuracy, supplier delay, unexpected demand).\r\n        *   Excess & Obsolete Stock (E&O) Value (by item, age, reason).\r\n        *   Inventory Aging Details (beyond basic expiry, e.g., slow-moving non-perishables by aging buckets).\r\n        *   Supplier Delivery Performance (On-Time In-Full - OTIF, lead time variance, quality rejection rates at receipt - from `procurement`/`supplier` data).\r\n        *   Cost Variance Analysis (Actual vs. Standard/Expected, if applicable).\r\n        *   Traceability Report Metrics (e.g., time to trace a batch forward/backward).\r\n        *   Cycle Count Accuracy.\r\n        *   Warehouse Space Utilization (if location data is detailed enough).\r\n    2.  **Dashboard Mockups/Wireframes:** For each dashboard (e.g., Overview, Costing, Efficiency, Quality), create simple mockups showing which KPIs are displayed, chart types (line, bar, pie, table), and filter options.\r\n    3.  **Data Source Mapping:** For each KPI, identify the specific data models and fields required from Inventory and other integrated modules.\r\n*   **Foolproof Notes:**\r\n    *   Prioritize KPIs based on business impact.\r\n    *   Ensure KPIs are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).\r\n*   **Verification:**\r\n    *   Stakeholder sign-off on defined KPIs and dashboard mockups.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Step 3.2: Develop Data Aggregation & Calculation UseCases\r\n\r\n*   **Task:** Create backend UseCases to fetch, aggregate, and calculate the data needed for each KPI.\r\n*   **Files:** New UseCases in `lib/features/inventory/domain/usecases/analytics/` (or a dedicated `analytics` feature module).\r\n*   **Implementation Details:**\r\n    1.  **Turnover Rate UseCase:**\r\n        *   Input: Period (e.g., last 30 days, YTD), Item/Category filter.\r\n        *   Logic: (COGS for period / Average Inventory Value for period). Requires COGS data (from Phase 1 costing) and historical inventory valuation snapshots or calculations.\r\n    2.  **Stockout Rate UseCase:**\r\n        *   Input: Period, Item/Category filter.\r\n        *   Logic: Needs a way to identify stockout events (e.g., demand recorded when QOH was zero, or unfulfilled order lines due to stock). May require data from `order_management` and `forecasting`.\r\n    3.  **E&O Stock UseCase:**\r\n        *   Input: Aging thresholds, Item/Category filter.\r\n        *   Logic: Identify stock with no movement for X days, or stock past its expiry date. Value using current valuation methods.\r\n    4.  **Inventory Aging UseCase (Advanced):**\r\n        *   Input: Aging buckets, Item/Category filter.\r\n        *   Logic: Categorize current stock (perishable and non-perishable) into defined aging buckets based on received date or production date.\r\n    5.  **Supplier Performance UseCase:**\r\n        *   Input: Supplier, Period.\r\n        *   Logic: Fetch PO data from `procurement` (expected vs. actual delivery dates, quantities ordered vs. received, quality rejections at receipt). Calculate OTIF, lead time variance.\r\n    6.  **Traceability Report UseCase:**\r\n        *   Input: Batch/Lot Number.\r\n        *   Logic: Traverse `InventoryMovementModel` records forward and backward from the initial receipt of the batch to its final disposition.\r\n    7.  **Other KPI UseCases:** Develop similar UseCases for each defined KPI, fetching data from relevant repositories (Inventory, Order Management, Procurement, etc.).\r\n*   **Foolproof Notes:**\r\n    *   These UseCases might involve complex queries and calculations. Optimize for performance.\r\n    *   Consider if some KPIs need to be calculated periodically by a background process and stored, rather than on-demand, if real-time calculation is too slow.\r\n*   **Verification:**\r\n    *   Unit tests for each UseCase with mock data covering various scenarios.\r\n    *   Validate calculations against manually computed examples.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Step 3.3: Design and Develop Dashboard UI Components\r\n\r\n*   **Task:** Create reusable UI components for displaying KPIs and dashboards in the Flutter application.\r\n*   **Files:** New widgets in `lib/features/inventory/presentation/analytics/` or a shared UI library.\r\n*   **Implementation Details:**\r\n    1.  **Chart Widgets:** Create or integrate charting libraries (e.g., `fl_chart`) for line charts, bar charts, pie charts, etc.\r\n    2.  **KPI Card Widget:** A widget to display a single KPI value with its title and trend indicator (e.g., up/down arrow).\r\n    3.  **Filter Components:** Date range pickers, dropdowns for item categories, supplier selection, etc.\r\n    4.  **Dashboard Layout Widgets:** Create main dashboard screens (e.g., `InventoryOverviewDashboardView`, `SupplierPerformanceDashboardView`) that arrange KPI cards and charts based on mockups.\r\n    5.  **Data Table Widget:** For displaying tabular data like E&O stock lists or traceability reports.\r\n*   **Foolproof Notes:**\r\n    *   Focus on clarity and ease of understanding for the end-users.\r\n    *   Ensure dashboards are responsive if viewed on different screen sizes (if applicable).\r\n*   **Verification:**\r\n    *   UI review of components and dashboard layouts against mockups.\r\n    *   Widgets are testable and display sample data correctly.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Step 3.4: Integrate UI with Analytics UseCases\r\n\r\n*   **Task:** Connect the dashboard UI components to the backend analytics UseCases to display live data.\r\n*   **Files:** State management (Blocs/Cubits/Providers) for analytics dashboards, UI view files.\r\n*   **Implementation Details:**\r\n    1.  **State Management:** For each dashboard or complex analytics view, implement state management to handle data fetching, loading states, error states, and filter changes.\r\n    2.  **Data Fetching:** When a dashboard is loaded or filters are applied, the state management layer calls the appropriate analytics UseCases.\r\n    3.  **Displaying Data:** The UI widgets listen to state changes and update to display the fetched KPI data, charts, and tables.\r\n*   **Foolproof Notes:**\r\n    *   Implement appropriate loading indicators and error messages.\r\n    *   Consider caching strategies for frequently accessed dashboard data if performance is an issue.\r\n*   **Verification:**\r\n    *   Manual testing: Navigate to dashboards, apply filters, and verify that correct data is displayed and charts are rendered as expected.\r\n    *   Check responsiveness to filter changes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Step 3.5: Develop Traceability Report Feature\r\n\r\n*   **Task:** Implement a dedicated feature to generate and display full traceability reports for a given batch/lot number.\r\n*   **Files:** New UI screen, state management, and integration with the `TraceabilityReportUseCase`.\r\n*   **Implementation Details:**\r\n    1.  **Input:** UI to enter a batch/lot number.\r\n    2.  **Display:** Present the traceability information in a clear, chronological order, showing all movements (receipt, internal transfers, quality changes, issues, sales).\r\n        *   Include details like timestamps, movement types, quantities, locations, associated documents (PO, SO), employee IDs.\r\n    3.  **Export (Optional):** Consider an option to export the report (e.g., to CSV or PDF).\r\n*   **Foolproof Notes:**\r\n    *   The report should be easy to read and follow.\r\n*   **Verification:**\r\n    *   Test with various batch/lot numbers that have different lifecycle complexities.\r\n    *   Verify accuracy of the traced path against raw movement data.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Step 3.6: Comprehensive Testing & Quality Assurance\r\n\r\n*   **Task:** Conduct thorough testing of all analytics and dashboard functionalities.\r\n*   **Implementation Details:**\r\n    1.  **Unit Tests:** For all analytics UseCases and critical UI logic.\r\n    2.  **Widget Tests:** For individual UI components and dashboard layouts.\r\n    3.  **Integration Tests:** Test the flow from UI filter changes to UseCase execution and data display.\r\n    4.  **Data Validation:** Crucially, validate the accuracy of displayed KPIs and reports against manually calculated values from a known dataset or against existing trusted reports if available.\r\n    5.  **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**\r\n        *   Involve stakeholders (management, finance, operations) to use the dashboards and reports with real or realistic data.\r\n        *   Gather feedback on usability, clarity, and accuracy.\r\n*   **Foolproof Notes:**\r\n    *   Pay special attention to edge cases in calculations (e.g., division by zero for turnover if average inventory is zero).\r\n*   **Verification:** All test cases passed, UAT sign-off, data accuracy confirmed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Step 3.7: Documentation Updates & Team Training\r\n\r\n*   **Task:** Update documentation and train users on the new analytics features.\r\n*   **Implementation Details:**\r\n    1.  **Technical Documentation:** Document analytics UseCases, data sources for KPIs, and UI component design.\r\n    2.  **User Documentation:** Create guides on how to access and interpret each dashboard and report. Explain what each KPI means and how it's calculated (at a high level).\r\n    3.  **Training:** Conduct training sessions for end-users on leveraging the analytics for decision-making.\r\n*   **Verification:** Documentation reviewed, training completed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Step 3.8: Deployment & Post-Deployment Monitoring\r\n\r\n*   **Task:** Plan and execute deployment, and monitor usage and performance post-deployment.\r\n*   **Implementation Details:**\r\n    1.  **Deployment Plan:** Standard deployment procedures.\r\n    2.  **Monitoring:**\r\n        *   Track dashboard load times and performance of analytics queries.\r\n        *   Gather user feedback on the usefulness of the dashboards and any desired enhancements.\r\n        *   Periodically re-validate KPI accuracy.\r\n*   **Verification:** Successful deployment, system stability, dashboards are being used and providing value.\r\n\r\n## 4.
