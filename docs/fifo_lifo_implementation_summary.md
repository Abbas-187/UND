# FIFO/LIFO Costing Implementation Summary

## Implementation Overview

The Industrial Inventory Enhancement project has successfully implemented multiple inventory costing methods to support accurate financial reporting and inventory valuation. This document summarizes the key features and capabilities implemented.

### Costing Methods Implemented

1. **FIFO (First-In, First-Out)**
   - Inventory is valued based on the oldest cost layers being consumed first
   - Ensures proper inventory valuation during price fluctuations
   - Provides realistic cost flow assumptions in most industries

2. **LIFO (Last-In, First-Out)**
   - Inventory is valued based on newest cost layers being consumed first
   - Useful for specific financial reporting requirements
   - Available for comparative analysis

3. **WAC (Weighted Average Cost)**
   - Inventory is valued at an average cost of all items
   - Simplifies inventory valuation
   - Reduces impact of price fluctuations

### Key Components

1. **Cost Layer Tracking**
   - Each receipt or positive adjustment generates a cost layer
   - Cost layers store: item ID, quantity, unit cost, batch/lot info, dates
   - System tracks consumption of cost layers according to the configured method

2. **Weighted Average Cost Maintenance**
   - The `InventoryItem.cost` property stores current weighted average cost
   - Updated automatically after every inventory transaction
   - Provides quick reference point for financial reporting

3. **Inventory Valuation Reporting**
   - Reports showing inventory value using any costing method
   - Comparative reports showing differences between methods
   - Support for warehouse-specific valuation

## Implementation Details

### Technical Architecture

The implementation follows clean architecture principles:

1. **Domain Layer**
   - Cost layer entity with full history tracking
   - Use cases for applying different costing methods
   - Repository interfaces for data access

2. **Data Layer**
   - Firebase implementation of repositories
   - Cost layer transaction history
   - Efficient data access patterns

### Key Use Cases

1. **CalculateWeightedAverageCostUseCase**
   - Updates WAC after every inventory receipt
   - Handles returns and adjustments
   - Maintains historical cost data

2. **CalculateOutboundMovementCostUseCase**
   - Consumes cost layers based on selected method (FIFO, LIFO)
   - Supports partial fulfillment
   - Handles edge cases (zero cost, returns)

3. **GenerateInventoryValuationReportUseCase**
   - Generates reports for any costing method
   - Creates comparative reports
   - Supports filtering by warehouse and date

## Testing Coverage

The implementation includes comprehensive testing:

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Core calculations for each costing method
   - Edge cases (zero quantity, returns, etc.)

2. **E2E Tests**
   - Complete inventory workflows
   - Multiple receipt and issue scenarios
   - Zero-cost inventory handling
   - Returns processing
   - Oversized issues (partial fulfillment)
   - Empty inventory scenarios

## Conclusion

The FIFO/LIFO costing implementation is complete and ready for production use. The system maintains accurate inventory valuations, supports multiple costing methods, and provides detailed reporting for financial analysis. This implementation meets all requirements outlined in the Phase 1 Industrial Inventory enhancements plan.

## Next Steps

1. Obtain formal sign-off from finance department
2. Document any additional requirements for Phase 2
3. Monitor system performance in production
