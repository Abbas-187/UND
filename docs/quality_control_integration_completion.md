## Technical Architecture

### Quality Status Flow
```
Goods Receipt → PENDING_INSPECTION → Quality Inspection → AVAILABLE/REJECTED/REWORK/BLOCKED
                                                      ↓
                                              Inventory Allocation (Quality-Aware)
```

### Key Components Integration
1. **Quality Status Model**: Central quality status management
2. **Update Use Case**: Quality status change processing
3. **Allocation Use Case**: Quality-aware inventory allocation
4. **Quality Service**: Orchestration and business logic
5. **Movement Integration**: Audit trail and traceability

### Data Model Enhancements
- **Batch Quality Status**: `batchQualityStatus` in item attributes
- **Quality History**: `batchQualityHistory` for audit trail
- **Quality Timestamps**: Last update tracking
- **Movement Integration**: Quality status change movements

## Usage Examples

### 1. Update Quality Status
```dart
final result = await updateQualityStatusUseCase.execute(
  inventoryItemId: 'item-123',
  batchLotNumber: 'BATCH-001',
  newQualityStatus: QualityStatus.available,
  reason: 'Passed quality inspection',
  userId: 'qc-inspector-001',
);
```

### 2. Quality-Aware Allocation
```dart
final request = InventoryAllocationRequest(
  itemId: 'item-123',
  requestedQuantity: 100.0,
  warehouseId: 'WH-001',
  requiredQualityStatuses: [QualityStatus.available],
  costingMethod: CostingMethod.fifo,
);

final result = await allocateQualityAwareInventoryUseCase.execute(request);
```

### 3. Quality Control Dashboard
```dart
final dashboard = await qualityControlService.getQualityControlDashboard();
print('Items pending inspection: ${dashboard.pendingInspectionCount}');
print('Critical items: ${dashboard.criticalItems.length}');
```

### 4. Process Quality Inspection
```dart
final inspectionRequest = QualityInspectionRequest(
  itemId: 'item-123',
  batchLotNumber: 'BATCH-001',
  inspectionType: 'Visual Inspection',
  inspectedBy: 'qc-inspector-001',
);

final inspectionResult = QualityInspectionResult(
  passed: true,
  newQualityStatus: QualityStatus.available,
  inspectionNotes: 'All quality parameters within specification',
);

final result = await qualityControlService.processQualityInspection(
  request: inspectionRequest,
  result: inspectionResult,
);
```
