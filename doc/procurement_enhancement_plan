# Procurement Module Enhancement Plan

## 1. Data Requirements
- Identify and ensure access to production plans, inventory levels, supplier info, and budget constraints.
- Implement or update repository/data source methods as needed.
- Ensure data is up-to-date and consistent across modules (consider caching and refresh strategies).
- Define clear interfaces for data retrieval to support future integrations (e.g., external ERP, supplier APIs).

## 2. Aggregate Production Needs
- For each selected production plan, sum up required raw materials by item.
- Create a map: `{itemId: totalRequired}`.
- Support multi-period planning (e.g., weekly, monthly) and allow for scenario analysis (what-if planning).
- Consider production plan changes and re-aggregation if plans are updated.

## 3. Check Inventory
- For each required item, fetch current inventory.
- Calculate `toProcure = totalRequired - currentInventory`.
- If `toProcure <= 0`, skip or flag as not needed.
- Factor in safety stock, reorder points, and minimum order quantities.
- Optionally, include items in transit or reserved stock in calculations.

## 4. Supplier Selection
- For each item to procure, select a preferred/approved supplier.
- Optionally, factor in lead time, price, reliability, and supplier performance history.
- Support multi-supplier strategies (split orders, backup suppliers).
- Allow for supplier constraints (minimum order, delivery schedules).

## 5. Budget Handling
- Calculate estimated total cost (sum of `toProcure * unitPrice`).
- If a budget limit is set, prioritize items or suggest alternatives.
- Provide warnings or require approval if over budget.
- Support cost optimization (e.g., bulk discounts, alternative suppliers).

## 6. Generate Procurement Items
- For each item, create a procurement line: itemId, name, quantity, unit, supplier, estimated cost, required date.
- Include additional metadata: urgency, notes, and links to production plans.
- Support grouping by supplier for efficient purchase order creation.

## 7. Validation
- Validate all required fields, logical dates, and non-negative quantities/costs.
- Return/throw structured errors if validation fails.
- Add business rule validation (e.g., cannot order below minimum quantity, cannot exceed max budget without approval).
- Provide user-friendly error messages and suggestions for resolution.

## 8. Audit Logging
- After generation, log the action using AuditMiddleware.
- Record all key actions: plan creation, modification, approval, and deletion.
- Store user, timestamp, and context for each action for traceability.
- Support audit log export for compliance and reporting.

## 9. Testing
- Write unit tests for the generation logic, including edge cases (e.g., zero inventory, over budget).
- Add integration tests for end-to-end procurement plan generation.
- Test error handling, validation, and audit logging.
- Use mock data and services to simulate real-world scenarios.

## 10. UI/UX Feedback
- Ensure the UI provides feedback for errors, warnings (e.g., over budget), and success.
- Display procurement plan details, validation issues, and audit history to users.
- Support user actions for resolving issues (e.g., edit, re-calculate, request approval).
- Provide progress indicators for long-running operations.

## 11. Extensibility & Integration
- Design the module to support future enhancements (e.g., automated reordering, supplier API integration).
- Document interfaces and extension points for other teams.
- Plan for integration with analytics, reporting, and notification modules.

## 12. Purchase Order (PO) Creation & Approval Enhancements

### PO Creation
- When creating a PO, require the requester to provide:
  - Reason for the request
  - Intended use of the material
  - Quantity justification (e.g., how many months of production it covers)
- Auto-calculate and display how long the requested quantity will last based on historical or forecasted usage.
- Allow attachment of supporting documents (e.g., quotations, specifications).
- Group items by supplier for efficient PO generation.
- Validate that requested items and quantities align with the approved procurement plan.

### PO Approval Workflow
- PO approval is a two-step process:
  1. Procurement Manager reviews and approves/declines.
  2. CEO reviews and gives final approval/decline.
- Each approval screen must display:
  - Reason for request
  - Intended use
  - Quantity and coverage period
  - All relevant item and supplier details
- UI should have:
  - Green Approve button
  - Red Decline button
- On Approve, require biometric validation (e.g., fingerprint, face ID) using device biometrics before finalizing approval.
- On Decline, require a reason for rejection.
- Log all approval actions (user, timestamp, decision, reason) in the audit trail.
- Notify relevant users of approval/decline status at each step.

## 13. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Enforce that only authorized users (Procurement Manager, CEO) can approve/decline POs.
- Implement permission checks at both the UI and data layers.
- Prevent the same user from both requesting and approving a PO.

## 14. Escalation & Delegation
- Allow for delegated approval if an approver is unavailable (with audit logging).
- Set escalation rules for urgent or overdue approvals.

## 15. Comprehensive Audit Trail
- Log every action (view, edit, approve, reject, escalate) with user, timestamp, device, and context.
- Support exportable audit logs for compliance and reporting.

## 16. Notifications & Reminders
- Automated notifications for pending approvals, rejections, escalations, and overdue items.
- Reminders for overdue approvals.

## 17. Change Management & Versioning
- Track and log all changes to procurement plans and POs, not just approvals.
- Implement versioning for procurement plans and POs.

## 18. Reporting & Analytics
- Provide built-in reports for approval cycle times, bottlenecks, compliance, and open/closed POs.
- Dashboard for procurement KPIs.

## 19. Disaster Recovery & Data Retention
- Define policies for backup, restore, and retention of procurement data and audit logs.

## 20. Security & Compliance
- Ensure data encryption at rest and in transit.
- Document compliance with relevant standards (e.g., SOX, ISO 9001, GDPR if applicable).
