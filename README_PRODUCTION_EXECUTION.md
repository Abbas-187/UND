# Production Execution Feature Implementation Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the steps required to implement the Production Execution feature for the UND Dairy Factory Management System.

## Overview

The Production Execution feature converts production plans into active execution records, tracks manufacturing processes in real-time, manages batch processing, performs quality control, and integrates with inventory management.

## Architecture

The feature follows a feature-first clean architecture approach:

- **Domain Layer**: Contains the business logic with entities, use cases, and repository interfaces.
- **Data Layer**: Implements the repository interfaces using Firebase Firestore.
- **Presentation Layer**: Provides UI components using Flutter widgets and Riverpod for state management.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Domain Layer

#### 1.1. Define Domain Entities

- [x] `ProductionExecutionModel`: Represents a production execution record
- [x] `ProductionBatchModel`: Represents a batch within a production execution
- [x] `QualityControlResultModel`: Represents quality control checks

#### 1.2. Define Repository Interfaces

- [x] `ProductionExecutionRepository`: Interface for managing production executions
- [x] `ProductionBatchRepository`: Interface for managing production batches
- [x] `QualityControlRepository`: Interface for managing quality control results

#### 1.3. Implement Use Cases

- [x] `CreateProductionExecutionUseCase`: Creates a new production execution
- [x] `ConvertPlanToExecutionUseCase`: Converts a production plan to an execution
- [x] `TrackBatchProcessUseCase`: Handles batch processing operations
- [x] `RecordQualityControlUseCase`: Manages quality control operations
- [x] `UpdateProductionExecutionStatusUseCase`: Updates execution status
- [x] `CompleteProductionExecutionUseCase`: Completes an execution
- [ ] `GetProductionStatisticsUseCase`: Retrieves production statistics

### 2. Data Layer

#### 2.1. Implement Repository Implementations

- [x] `ProductionExecutionRepositoryImpl`: Implements the execution repository

#### 2.2. Firebase Integration

- [ ] Set up Firestore collections:
  - `productionExecutions`: Stores execution records
  - `productionBatches`: Stores batch records
  - `qualityControlResults`: Stores quality control records
- [ ] Create Firebase indexes for efficient queries
- [ ] Set up security rules for collections

#### 2.3. Integration with Other Modules

- [ ] Implement inventory integration for material consumption
- [ ] Create hooks for quality control alerts and notifications
- [ ] Connect to production scheduling module for plan conversion

### 3. Presentation Layer

#### 3.1. Create Riverpod Providers

- [x] `ProductionExecutionProviders`: Providers for execution operations
- [x] `ProductionBatchProviders`: Providers for batch operations
- [x] `QualityControlProviders`: Providers for quality control operations

#### 3.2. Implement UI Screens

- [x] `ProductionExecutionListScreen`: Lists all production executions
- [ ] `ProductionExecutionDetailScreen`: Shows execution details
- [x] `BatchTrackingScreen`: Tracks an individual batch
- [ ] `QualityControlScreen`: Records quality control checks

#### 3.3. Implement UI Widgets

- [x] `BatchDetailCard`: Displays batch information
- [x] `ProcessParametersForm`: Form for updating process parameters
- [x] `QualityControlForm`: Form for recording quality control checks
- [ ] `ExecutionStatusWidget`: Shows execution status with progress indicators
- [ ] `MaterialConsumptionWidget`: Shows material consumption

### 4. Testing

#### 4.1. Unit Tests

- [x] `TrackBatchProcessUseCaseTest`: Tests the batch tracking use case
- [ ] `RecordQualityControlUseCaseTest`: Tests the quality control use case
- [ ] `ProductionBatchRepositoryImplTest`: Tests the batch repository implementation
- [ ] `QualityControlRepositoryImplTest`: Tests the quality control repository implementation

#### 4.2. Widget Tests

- [x] `BatchDetailCardTest`: Tests the batch detail card widget
- [ ] `ProcessParametersFormTest`: Tests the process parameters form
- [ ] `QualityControlFormTest`: Tests the quality control form

#### 4.3. Integration Tests

- [ ] `ProductionExecutionFlowTest`: Tests the entire production execution flow
- [ ] `FirebaseIntegrationTest`: Tests Firebase integration
- [ ] `InventoryIntegrationTest`: Tests integration with inventory module

### 5. Documentation and Deployment

#### 5.1. Documentation

- [ ] Write API documentation for all classes
- [ ] Create user documentation for production execution workflow
- [ ] Document integration points with other modules

#### 5.2. Deployment

- [ ] Test feature in development environment
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Conduct user acceptance testing
- [ ] Deploy to production environment

## Integration with Inventory Management

The Production Execution feature integrates with the Inventory Management module to handle material consumption. Here's how to implement this integration:

1. **Material Reservation**:
   - When a production execution starts, reserve the required materials in inventory.
   - Use `ReserveMaterialsUseCase` from the Inventory module.

2. **Material Consumption Tracking**:
   - During batch processing, track actual material consumption.
   - Update the inventory quantities accordingly.
   - Implement a `RecordMaterialConsumptionUseCase` that calls both Production and Inventory repositories.

3. **Finished Product Addition**:
   - When a batch is completed, add the produced items to inventory.
   - Use `AddProductToInventoryUseCase` from the Inventory module.

## Query Optimization for Firebase

To optimize Firestore performance:

1. **Indexes**:
   - Create composite indexes for frequently used queries:
     - `productionExecutions`: (status, scheduledDate)
     - `productionBatches`: (executionId, createdAt)
     - `qualityControlResults`: (batchId, performedAt)

2. **Data Structuring**:
   - Keep documents small by avoiding deep nesting.
   - Use references instead of duplicating data.
   - For large collections, implement pagination in the UI.

3. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Use Firestore's offline persistence.
   - Implement application-level caching for frequently accessed data.
   - Consider using Riverpod's caching capabilities.

## Future Modularization

As the production module grows, consider extracting it as a separate Flutter package:

1. **Package Structure**:
   ```
   packages/
     production/
       lib/
         src/
           domain/
           data/
           presentation/
         production.dart
   ```

2. **Dependency Management**:
   - Define clear interfaces for communication with other modules.
   - Use dependency injection to manage module dependencies.
   - Consider using an event bus for cross-module communication.

3. **Phased Approach**:
   - Start by refactoring the domain layer into a separate package.
   - Then move the data layer, keeping Firebase dependencies isolated.
   - Finally, extract the presentation layer, exposing only necessary widgets.
